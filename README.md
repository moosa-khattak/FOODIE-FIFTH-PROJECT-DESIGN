🧠 Project Overview

The Foodie website represents a complete restaurant landing page concept, designed to provide users with a smooth and engaging experience.
It combines elegance with functionality — from a dynamic Navbar and vibrant Hero Section to a feature-rich Services area, App Download Banner, and Testimonial Section.

Each section was carefully designed to highlight both UI/UX creativity and frontend coding precision.
